### How to Link a Channel Across Different Servers (Advanced)

To link a channel from Server A into a message in Server B, you need the Channel ID:

1. Enable Developer Mode: Go to User Settings > Advanced and toggle on Developer Mode.
2. Copy ID: Right-click the channel name (or long-press on mobile) and select Copy Channel ID.
3. Use this Syntax: In your message, type `<#CHANNEL_ID>` (replacing CHANNEL_ID with the numbers you copied).
